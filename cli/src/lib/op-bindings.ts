/**
 * Which platform operation each CLI command exposes — and, for the ones the CLI
 * deliberately does not expose, why.
 *
 * The CLI was the last of the five operation surfaces with no drift check. The
 * MCP catalog, the agent registry and the in-app chat toolset each partition
 * `ALL_OPERATIONS` into "advertised" and "excluded, with a reason", enforced by
 * a test that fails both when an operation is missed and when an exclusion goes
 * stale. This is that partition for the CLI.
 *
 * The reason it matters here specifically: an operation with no CLI binding is
 * invisible from a shell script, and nothing about adding an SDK operation
 * prompts anyone to notice. `list_eval_suite_runs` sat unreachable for exactly
 * that reason — the operation, the route and the MCP tool all existed.
 *
 * A binding names the command path a user would type. The test resolves each
 * one against the real Commander tree, so an entry claiming a command that was
 * never registered (or was later renamed) fails rather than quietly asserting
 * coverage that does not exist.
