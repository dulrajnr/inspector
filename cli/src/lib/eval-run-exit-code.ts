/**
 * Exit code for `mcpjam cloud eval run --wait`.
 *
 * `eval run` (unlike `eval gate`) is not a gate — by default it launches and
 * reports, and a run that finished having FAILED its cases still exits 0.
 * `--wait` is different: a caller who asked this process to sit and watch a
 * run to completion is asking it to tell them how the run went, and "how did
 * it go" has six honest answers, not two.
 *
 * ```text
 *   0 — every waited run passed, unanimously, and (when a report was
 *       requested) every report was assembled cleanly.
 *   1 — a run COMPLETED with result: "failed". THE ONLY PRODUCER OF 1.
 *       Nothing else may ever report this code — see the doctrine below.
 *   2 — usage error (bad flags, `--reporter` without `--wait`, an invalid
 *       suite file). Thrown by Commander or by suite-file validation, never
 *       produced by this module — see `SUITE_FILE_RUN_INVALID_EXIT_CODE`.
 *   3 — auth failed: no credential, or the platform said UNAUTHORIZED /
 *       FORBIDDEN / OAUTH_REQUIRED, at launch OR mid-poll (a token that
 *       expired during a long wait). Zero-credit guarantee: reached before
 *       any run started, or a credential that stopped being valid partway
 *       through observing runs that were already paid for.
 *   4 — connection/setup failed before evaluation: a launch the CLI itself
 *       observed fail for a reason that is not auth and not "the suite file
 *       was invalid" (network, timeout, rate limit, an unrecognized launch
 *       error, a partial or wholly-failed fan-out), or a local `--out`
 *       write failure.
 *   5 — no valid verdict: inconclusive, a null/unrecognized result, a run
 *       whose own STATUS is failed/cancelled/timed_out, a wait that hit its
 *       deadline with the run still non-terminal, a mid-poll failure that
 *       was not auth-shaped, or a report that could not be assembled
 *       (iteration fetch failed, or the walk did not complete).
 * ```
 *
 * ## No infrastructure condition may ever map to 1
 *
 * Copied verbatim from `eval-gate-exit-code.ts`, because it is the one rule
 * that matters more than the others: a CI job that fails a release because a
 * network call flaked, and reports it as "the server regressed", trains
 * people to ignore the gate. Every non-verdict failure in this module — auth,
 * connection, timeout, an execution crash, an unmeasurable run — lands on 3,
 * 4, or 5. Only a run that reached `status: "completed"` with
 * `result: "failed"` may ever produce 1.
 *
 * ## Severity order: 1 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 0
 *
 * A launch can fan out to several targets, so the exit code is a worst-of
 * merge over every started run plus every wait/report failure. The order is
 * not arbitrary:
 *
 * - **1 first.** A real verdict failure is never masked by a sibling's
 *   infrastructure noise. Nothing but a verdict produces 1, and nothing
 *   hides a verdict's 1 — one invariant, easy to test.
 * - **3 beats 4.** A credential failure poisons every other observation (a
 *   mid-poll 401 may be *why* siblings show no verdict) and is prerequisite
 *   to fixing anything else.
 * - **4 beats 5.** A definite CLI-observed setup defect ("target 2 never
 *   launched: host offline") is more actionable than an absence ("no verdict
 *   observed"), and 5-conditions are frequently downstream of the
 *   4-condition.
 * - **0 only when unanimous** — every run passed, and, when a report was
 *   requested, every report was assembled.
 *
 * Structural precedent: `conformanceSuiteExitCode` in
 * `cli/src/lib/conformance-exit-code.ts` (failure outranks incomplete).
 *
 * ## `eval gate` keeps its four codes — deliberately
 *
 * `eval gate` (`eval-gate-exit-code.ts`) is untouched by this module and
 * keeps its four-code contract (0/1/2/3, where 3 = incomplete/non-gateable)
 * in v1. That is not an oversight: `gate`'s exit 3 means "incomplete", and
 * remapping it to a six-code scheme would invert retry-on-3 pipelines that
 * already treat 3 as safe to retry. A six-code migration for `gate` is
 * deferred behind a future explicit opt-in flag. Two undocumented exit-code
 * contracts must never coexist — this doc block and the CLI docs
 * (`docs/cli/reference.mdx`, `docs/cli/ci.mdx`) are the checked-in record of
 * both, and `gate`'s own doc block is the record of its exception.
 *
 * ## `billing_limit_reached` → 4, not 3
 *
 * The PRD's "3 auth failed (before work, zero credits)" is a guarantee
 * *about* code 3 — no work was done, no credits were burned — not a claim
 * that running out of credits is an auth failure. Entitlement/billing is a
 * setup failure the CLI observed before evaluation, so it maps to 4 through
 * the same "else" bucket as every other non-auth, non-invalid launch error
 * (network, timeout, rate limit, an error code this CLI has never seen).
 *
 * This holds even when the v1 API's own wire mapping obscures it: the
 * public error union has no billing member, so the server collapses
 * `BILLING_LIMIT_REACHED` onto the wire code `FORBIDDEN` — indistinguishable
 * from a real credential rejection by code alone. The original reason
 * survives in `details.code`, and `classifyLaunchErrorExitCode` checks it
 * BEFORE the auth-shaped set, so a disguised billing failure still reads as
 * 4, never 3.
 *
 * ## `status: "failed"` → 5, not 4
 *
 * From the CLI's vantage point, "setup failed before evaluation" and
 * "crashed mid-run" are indistinguishable in the run record: both surface as
 * `status: "failed"`. This initiative's attribution doctrine forbids
 * manufacturing the more specific claim — a measurable-and-wrong signal is
 * worse than an unmeasured one — so `status: "failed"` maps to 5 (no valid
 * verdict), never to 4 (a condition this module reserves for failures the
 * CLI itself observed pre-evaluation: a launch rejection, a wait-phase
 * network error, a local `--out` write failure). If the platform later
 * distinguishes setup-abort from mid-run crash, refining `status: "failed"`
 * to 4 is a SECOND behavior change, not a bugfix of this one — track it
 * separately when that distinction ships.
 *
 * ## Migration note
 *
 * `eval run --wait` shipped 2026-08-23 with the legacy two-outcome exit
 * contract (0 launch-and-waited-fine, 1 launch-or-completion problem). This
 * module replaces that with the six-code contract above as a direct flip —
 * no opt-in flag — because the compatibility window was days old. Default
 * (no `--wait`) behavior is untouched by this module and stays byte-
 * identical.
 *
 * ## The wait phase's own outer preamble is covered too
 *
 * Every PER-TARGET poll failure is captured and classified (see the
 * `errorCode` capture at the eval.ts call site). The one thing that can
 * fail from OUTSIDE that per-target handling — before the wait phase's
 * callback even starts — is `runPlatformOperation`'s own internal
 * `preflightCloudCredentials` recheck, so the eval.ts call site re-runs
 * that check explicitly first, exactly mirroring the launch-phase preflight
 * above: any resulting CliError with `exitCode !== 2` is remapped straight
 * to 3, unconditionally, not through {@link classifyWaitErrorExitCode} —
 * the only realistic failure at this point IS a credential, so there is no
 * "else" case to classify. The launch receipt is written before that
 * rethrow, for the same reason the timeout and `--out` paths write it
 * first: it is the only record of run ids already paid for.
