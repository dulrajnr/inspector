/**
 * Live, project-aware validation of a suite file's DETERMINISTIC tool
 * references.
 *
 * `loadEvalSuiteFile` answers "is this a valid suite file?" offline. It cannot
 * answer "will this actually run?", because that question is about a project's
 * live tool inventory rather than about the bytes. This module answers the
 * second question, and it is deliberately the ONLY implementation of it: both
 * `eval validate --project` and every `eval run --file` call
 * {@link validateImportToolReferences}, so the check a human runs before
 * committing a converted suite and the check the launcher runs before spending
 * money cannot drift into two different verdicts.
 *
 * What counts as a DETERMINISTIC reference, and why the line is where it is:
 *
 *   - A `toolCall` step IS one. It names a server and a tool and executes them
 *     with no model in the loop, so a name that does not exist is a certain
 *     failure, knowable now.
 *   - Prompt text is NOT one, even when it names a tool. The model decides what
 *     to call; a mention is a hint, not a call.
 *   - An `assert` step (`toolCalledWith`, `widgetToolCalled`) is NOT one. It is
 *     an EXPECTATION about what happened, and "the model was supposed to call a
 *     tool that does not exist" is a case that legitimately fails at run time
 *     rather than a file that cannot be launched. Refusing to launch over one
 *     would make a negative test unwritable.
 *
 * Two properties this module is built around:
 *
 *   - **Per-target, never a union.** A case that runs against three targets has
 *     to resolve in all three. Taking the union of their tool inventories would
 *     green-light a case that fails on two of them, which is precisely the
 *     false negative a pre-flight check exists to prevent.
 *   - **Fail closed, and never fabricate.** An auth failure, an unreachable
 *     project, or a target set this deployment cannot enumerate is a COMMAND
 *     error — it says the check could not be made. It is never reported as a
 *     finding about the file, because "your file names a tool that does not
 *     exist" and "we could not look" send the author to two different places.
