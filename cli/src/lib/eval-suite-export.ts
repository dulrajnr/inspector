/**
 * Project a HOSTED eval suite onto a suite file — or refuse.
 *
 * `eval export` reads a suite the platform owns and writes a file the suite-file
 * contract owns, and the two vocabularies do not line up field for field. Where
 * they do, the mapping is verbatim. Where they do not, this module emits an
 * `UNSUPPORTED_SUITE_EXPORT` finding and the command writes NOTHING.
 *
 * ── Why fail-closed, and why nothing partial ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A suite file is read back and run. A file that quietly dropped a host
 * attachment, a second model, a judge or a match-option override still parses,
 * still runs, and measures something other than what the dashboard measures —
 * while carrying the dashboard's suite id, so its results join the same
 * history. There is no warning comment that fixes that: a partial file is a
 * wrong file with an apology in it. So an export is all or nothing.
 *
 * ── The exactness proof ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two of the shapes the file reuses are deliberately OPEN — a tool call's
 * `arguments` and `predicateSchema` (`sdk/src/contract/suite-file.ts:18-37`) —
 * and an open zod object STRIPS unknown keys instead of rejecting them. So
 * "the candidate validated" is not by itself proof that nothing was lost. The
 * proof is the deep-equality check after it: the validator's OUTPUT must equal
 * the candidate it was given, key for key. Anything zod quietly removed shows
 * up there as a finding naming the path, instead of as a smaller file.
