/**
 * One translator from a Convex write failure to a v1 HTTP error.
 *
 * Every write router grew its own near-copy of this — `hosts.ts`, `images.ts`,
 * `environments.ts`, and (before this module) the new `projects.ts` and
 * `servers.ts`. Five copies meant five different answers to the same question:
 * whether a permission failure is a 403 or a 404, whether a Convex timeout is
 * reported to the caller as bad input, and how much of Convex's own error prose
 * leaks into a public response.
 *
 * The rules, in one place:
 *
 *   - **Structured first.** A backend mutation raising
 *     `ConvexError({ code, message })` is authoritative: CONFLICT → 409,
 *     VALIDATION → 400, NOT_FOUND → 404, FORBIDDEN → see below. Prose sniffing
 *     is the mixed-version fallback for a deployment that predates the
 *     structured throw, not the primary path.
 *   - **FORBIDDEN answers 404 unless it is explicitly about admin rights.**
 *     Telling an outsider "you are not an admin here" confirms the resource
 *     exists. Only a message that names the admin requirement — which the caller
 *     can only reach if they are already a member — earns a 403.
 *   - **`kind: 'forbidden'` is a TIER denial and answers 403.** A different
 *     shape from the `FORBIDDEN` code above, raised only once membership has
 *     already resolved, so hiding it behind a 404 would tell a legitimate
 *     member their own resource does not exist. Still subject to
 *     `adminFailureIsForbidden` for the resources that deliberately hide their
 *     gate.
 *   - **Infrastructure failures are 5xx.** A timeout or a reset socket is not
 *     the caller's bad input; those defer to `mapRuntimeError` so a transient
 *     outage is not reported as a validation error.
 *   - **An unrecognized failure is a 500, and it is logged.** Everything above
 *     is a recognized outcome; what falls past all of it is a write path we do
 *     not understand, which is ours. It used to answer 400 with Convex's prose
 *     and no log at all — a broken write path reporting itself as the caller's
 *     mistake, below every 5xx monitor and invisible in Sentry.
 *   - **Convex's prose is scrubbed** of `[Request ID: …]`, `Server Error` and
 *     `Uncaught ConvexError:` before it can reach a public response body, and
 *     is not forwarded at all on the 500.
 *
 * `resource` names what the caller was addressing, so a not-found reads
 * "Server not found" rather than every router borrowing whichever noun the
 * copy it was forked from happened to use.

  // time a user submits a journey with no goal, and hand that user a generic

  // This used to be a 400 VALIDATION_ERROR carrying Convex's prose, which got
  // the reporting exactly backwards. Every branch above is a recognized
  // outcome: a structured `ConvexError` code, string-data prose the backend
  // wrote for the caller, or one of the prose shapes a mixed-version
  // deployment still throws. An error that matches NONE of them is a write
  // path we do not understand — a mutation throwing a new code, a renamed or
  // undeployed function, a broken deploy — and none of those are the
  // caller's malformed input.
  //
  // Reporting them as 400 was invisible twice over: no 5xx monitor counts a
  // 400, and this function had no logger at all, so a wholly broken write path
  // could answer "your request was invalid" to every caller and emit nothing
  // anywhere. 500 puts it back in the range the monitors watch, and the log
  // line below is what names it once it is there.
  //
  // The message stops being forwarded for the same reason the read translator
  // never forwards its upstream text: it is written for us, it can carry
  // function names, argument-validator output with the arguments in it, and
  // request ids — a free read of our internals for anyone who can reach the
  // route. The detail goes to the log; the caller gets the route's own copy.
  // `logger.warn`, NOT `logger.error`, and the difference is one Sentry event
  // rather than two. Every caller THROWS the `WebRouteError` this returns, so
  // `v1OnError` maps it — 500 + INTERNAL_ERROR, exactly what the
  // `mcpjam_internal` boundary promotes — and captures it there. A
  // `logger.error` here would capture a *different* object (the redacted
  // Error) which carries no stamp of its own, so the same failure would arrive
  // in Sentry twice, under two fingerprints. This log is the Axiom record; the
  // capture belongs to the envelope that owns the boundary declaration.
  //
  // The detail goes under `detail`, not `message`: `ingestToAxiom` spreads the
  // context and THEN sets `message` from its first argument, so a `message`
  // key here would be silently overwritten and the diagnosis lost.
