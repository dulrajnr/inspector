/**
 * The public agent's operation registry — one entry per tool, and the single
 * place a new tool is declared.
 *
 * WHY A REGISTRY. Adding an operation to this surface used to mean editing
 * five places that had no way of knowing about each other: the op list, the
 * idempotency set, the proposal describer, the system prompt, and the Slack
 * app's button-label table. Four of those were hand-maintained lookups keyed by
 * operation name, so the failure mode of forgetting one was silent — a write
 * left out of the idempotency set quietly loses retry safety, a proposal with
 * no describer renders its raw operation name at a human, a tool with no prompt
 * note is one the model never learns when to reach for.
 *
 * So the entry carries the metadata and everything else is DERIVED:
 *
 *   - `AGENT_API_OPERATIONS` / `AGENT_API_GATED_OPERATIONS` — the two tiers.
 *   - `WRITE_OPERATION_NAMES` — direct ∧ !readOnly, read off the operation's
 *     own `readOnly` flag rather than restated. The op catalog already knows
 *     which operations persist; asking it is not just less typing, it is the
 *     only version of this set that cannot drift.
 *   - the proposal's human-facing copy (`describe`, `buttonLabel`, `kind`,
 *     `confirmSeverity`), which now travels IN the response envelope so a host
 *     renders what the server decided instead of re-deriving it from an
 *     operation name it happens to recognise.
 *   - the system prompt's operation-specific guidance (`promptNotes`).
 *
 * TIERS. `direct` executes. `gated` validates, persists a proposal, and
 * returns an opaque id for a human to approve — the tier for anything that
 * SPENDS or reaches outside MCPJam. The discriminated union makes `proposal`
 * mandatory on a gated entry at the type level, so a gated op cannot be added
 * without saying what its approval prompt says.
 *
 * NOT AN AUTHORIZATION BOUNDARY. The tier decides which tool the model is
 * offered; the clamp, the delegated JWT, and the proposal claim are what make
 * the call safe. A registry edit widens the surface — review it as one.

/**
 * Freeze a CLIENT WRITE at proposal time: pin the target, the tokens, and what

 *
 * Three things about a client-edit proposal can change between minting it and a
 * human clicking, and each one breaks the approval differently:
 *
 *   1. THE TARGET. The model may write a NAME. A rename between propose and
 *      click would repoint the approved edit at whatever answers to that name
 *      then — possibly a different client entirely. Resolving the selector to
 *      an exact id makes "edit Claude" mean one row forever.
 *   2. THE TOKENS. `expectedConfigId` / `expectedName` are what make the write
 *      compare-and-set. Verified here against a server read, so a model that
 *      invented a token, or echoed one from a stale read, is refused at MINT
 *      time rather than after a human has already agreed to the edit.
 *   3. WHAT IT AFFECTS. The approval copy quotes impact counts. If an
 *      environment is attached between propose and click, the edit would
 *      silently affect more than the human read. `expectedImpact` is injected
 *      from the same detail read the copy is built from, and it is a REAL
 *      operation field, so it reaches the backend precondition and turns that
 *      case into a 409 requiring a fresh proposal.
 *
 * `clientLabel` and `resolvedClientId` are proposal-only: display and proof.
 * Operation validation strips them at execution — they are not operation
 * fields, and no schema accepts them.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED via `requiredFrozenKeys`. A proposal that cannot pin its target
 * or its impact must not exist: an unpinned one would execute against a name,
 * and one without impact would carry approval copy nothing checks. The
 * `getClient` read is the DEFAULT one, so a private User Testing backing client
 * is a 404 here — the agent surface never opts into those.
