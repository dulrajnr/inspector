/**
 * Public v1 Project Environment surface: CRUD + archive/restore + launch
 * resolution over a project's named execution bundles.
 *
 * A Project Environment is a live-editable, project-scoped bundle that eval
 * suites and journeys run against: one host, an optional standalone server
 * group, an optional pinned skill selection, and optional pinned plugin
 * versions. It is NOT a Computer sandbox image (see ./images.ts, which owns
 * `/projects/:projectId/images` and still calls the Convex
 * `computerEnvironments:*` module) and NOT the eval-suite `environment`
 * servers bag.
 *
 * These routes are thin proxies over the same Convex `projectEnvironments:*`
 * functions the hosted UI uses, called with the request's Convex bearer. Every
 * one of those functions takes the path's `projectId` and scopes to it inside
 * Convex, so a valid id from another of the caller's projects reads as
 * NOT_FOUND — there is no route-side ownership preflight.
 *
 * Two contracts the public surface must not smooth over:
 *
 *  1. OPTIMISTIC CONCURRENCY. Every mutation takes the `expectedRevision` the
 *     caller last read. The route REQUIRES it in the body rather than
 *     re-reading the current revision server-side: silently supplying the
 *     current value would turn the backend's safe concurrent-edit rejection
 *     into a last-write-wins clobber. A stale value is a 409.
 *
 *  2. CLEAR-VS-UNCHANGED. On PATCH, an omitted field is left unchanged and an
 *     explicit `null` CLEARS it. Empty arrays are rejected by the backend on
 *     purpose ("clear the selection instead"), so `[]` is a 400, not a clear.
 *
 * Reads require project membership. EDITING an existing environment (patch,
 * archive, restore) requires project ADMIN, since that changes execution config
 * other people's suites already run. CREATING one does not: `create`,
 * `ensure-adhoc`, and `name` are member-gated, because every surface a member
 * composes a setup from is member-reachable and an admin gate would fail them
 * at launch after the work was done. Pinning plugin versions escalates to ADMIN
 * on both create paths. An `sk_` key acts as the user it is bound to, so a
 * non-admin's key gets 403 on the admin writes.
