/**
 * `POST /api/v1/chat-sessions/messages` — one agent Playground turn.
 *
 * Send a message, get back the assistant's reply PLUS everything a
 * participant in the conversation could not see: which tools the model
 * picked, the arguments it sent, what each server actually returned, how long
 * each call took, and the turn's token usage. Pass the returned `sessionId`
 * back to continue; omit it to start a new session.
 *
 * WHY NOT `/api/web/chat-v2`. That route already runs this loop, and it speaks
 * a streaming AI-SDK UI-message protocol with a Hono `Context` baked through
 * it. De-streaming it would fork the one handler the product's own Playground
 * depends on. Instead this clones the SYNCHRONOUS-JSON packaging that
 * `routes/v1/agent.ts` already proved (wall clock, per-org concurrency,
 * `runUnifiedAssistantTurn` with `streamSink: "none"`) and points it at the
 * caller's project servers with persistence ON.
 *
 * SPEND SAFETY IS THE DESIGN, not a mitigation. A synchronous endpoint that
 * spends money is exposed to the oldest failure in HTTP: the client times out,
 * retries, and pays twice. Three things stop that, in this order:
 *
 *   1. `idempotencyKey` is REQUIRED. Not optional-with-a-fallback like the
 *      agent route's — there is no legacy caller to preserve, and a spend
 *      endpoint that lets you skip the safety is a spend endpoint that will be
 *      called without it.
 *   2. A Convex TURN LEASE is claimed BEFORE any model call. Same key on a
 *      completed turn replays the answer instead of re-running it; a second
 *      concurrent turn on one session is refused rather than interleaved.
 *      Cross-replica by construction, because the hosted plane has no
 *      affinity and an in-process map would be decorative.
 *   3. The version-conflict 409 is the BACKSTOP, not the mechanism. It fires
 *      after the spend, which makes it a damage report; the lease is what
 *      prevents the damage.
 *
 * TOOL EFFECTS ARE A SEPARATE AXIS FROM SPEND. `toolMode` defaults to
 * `read_only`, which advertises only tools the server annotated
 * `readOnlyHint: true`. That hint is server-asserted — a server may mislabel a
 * mutating tool — so this is a policy the host applies, not a guarantee it can
 * verify, and the operation description says so. `auto` advertises everything
 * and may cause real side effects through arbitrary third-party tools.
 *
 * CONFIG IS FIRST-TURN-ONLY. Model, target, system prompt and tool mode pin at
 * session creation and are stored in `resumeConfig`; a continuation that
 * resends any of them is refused with `CONFIG_ON_CONTINUATION` rather than
 * silently repinned. The backend enforces the same thing at the ingest
 * boundary (`preserveAgentResumePins`), which is the actual guarantee — this
 * check is the friendly error.
