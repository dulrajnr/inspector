/**
 * Freezing a CLIENT WRITE proposal.
 *
 * A proposal is a contract about a specific action, and the approval route
 * executes exactly the arguments stored with it. For a client edit, three
 * things can drift between minting and clicking, and each breaks the approval
 * differently: the TARGET (a name can be repointed by a rename), the TOKENS
 * (a made-up `expectedConfigId` turns compare-and-set into "overwrite whatever
 * is there"), and the IMPACT (a consumer attached in between makes the card's
 * blast-radius sentence a lie). These pin all three.
