 * The complete set of operations the spec advertises as needing NO credential.

 * Written out rather than derived, because "this endpoint is public" is the
 * single highest-consequence claim the spec makes and it must not be reachable
 * by accident. The spec sets `security: [{ bearerAuth: [] }]` globally, and an
 * operation opts out with `security: []` — a two-character edit, in a file
 * nobody diffs line by line, that turns an authenticated endpoint into an open
 * one. Before this list existed the drift test read the GLOBAL requirement,
 * found it, and passed every operation regardless of what it declared for
 * itself.
 *
 * Both directions are checked: a new `security: []` that is not listed here
 * fails, and an entry here that no longer declares it fails too.
 *
 * Adding to this list is a security decision. The two that are on it serve
 * static, project-agnostic host/model metadata that Convex also exposes
 * unauthenticated, and they mount BEFORE the v1 bearer middleware so that
 * zero-credential consumers — the OSS CLI's `mcpjam compat`, the SDK's
 * catalog default, share-link previews — work at all.
