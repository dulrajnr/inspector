/**
 * The registry's derivation contracts.
 *
 * The point of moving the tool surface into a registry was to delete four
 * hand-maintained lookups whose failure mode was SILENT. These tests are what
 * make that safe: they assert the derived sets follow mechanically from each
 * operation's own metadata, so a new entry cannot quietly land in the wrong
 * one.
 *
 * The prompt snapshot is the pure-refactor gate. It is byte-compared against
 * the literal the prompt used to be, so the assembly step can be shown to have
 * changed nothing the model sees — and, once operations start contributing
 * notes, it stays the place where a prompt change is a visible diff rather than
 * an invisible cache invalidation.

  "- Before planning anything that authors, launches or publishes, call `get_capabilities` for the project. Your tool list is identical for every caller, so it cannot tell you that this organization is not in the Swarms beta or that you are a member where the action needs an admin.

  "- `request_wave_insights` spends against a daily budget SHARED with user-testing insights — burning it here takes it from there. Read the run scorecards first; they are free and usually explain the failure without a model pass.",
  "- For user testing, read `get_user_testing_metrics` and `list_user_testing_findings` first. They answer how a scenario is going without pulling real visitors' conversations into the turn, which is both the privacy-preserving move and the cheaper one.",
  "- `get_user_testing_usage` carries a `scan.truncated` flag. When it is true the rates were computed over the most recent sessions rather than all of them — say so if you quote them, or you turn a conditional number into a claim about the whole scenario.",
  "- `set_user_testing_guest_execution` REPLACES every cap at once, so send all of them: read the current values first, or you will silently reset a limit someone set deliberately.",
  "- `create_client` mints a NEW client and changes nothing that exists. To change an existing one, use `update_client` — never create a near-duplicate to work around a failed edit.",
  "- Editing a client is a three-step loop: call `get_client` first; echo its `configId` back as `expectedConfigId` (and its `name` as `expectedName` when you are renaming); on a conflict, re-read and retry with the fresh values. Never guess a token.",

  "- A client edit changes what every later run of every environment, scenario and journey on it executes. Say what you are changing and what it affects before proposing it.",
  "- `set_client_servers` REPLACES the server set: every server you leave out is detached. Read the current list with `get_client` first, and send `expectedConfigId` from the same read.",
