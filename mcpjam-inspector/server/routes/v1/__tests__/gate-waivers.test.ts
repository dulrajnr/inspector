/**
 * The v1 gate-waiver surface (Evals v2, Lane E / step E5b).
 *
 * Three properties carry the weight here, and each of them is a way this
 * endpoint could look correct while being wrong:
 *
 *   1. THE REFUSALS KEEP THEIR OWN COPY. Five distinct `gate_waiver_*` codes
 *      arrive as structured ConvexErrors, and every one carries a message the
 *      backend wrote for the caller — the unscoped-suite one names a remedy
 *      nobody would guess. An unrecognized code falls past every branch in
 *      `translateConvexWriteError` into a 500 with the message stripped, so
 *      "it returns 400" is not enough: the message has to survive.
 *
 *   2. 403 AND 404 ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS. A caller who resolved membership but
 *      lacks the manage tier has already established the suite exists; telling
 *      them "not found" sends a legitimate member hunting for a run in front of
 *      them. A caller who cannot see the scope at all still gets 404.
 *
 *   3. THE BODY IS STRICT. A non-strict v1 body strips unknown keys and answers
 *      200 for a request that did something other than what was written — a
 *      known bug class in this router, and a bad one on the endpoint whose
 *      entire purpose is to be an auditable record.
