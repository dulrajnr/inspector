/**
 * ONE builder for `getToolsForAiSdk`'s host-derived options.
 *
 * `MCPClientManager.getToolsForAiSdk(serverIds?, options = {})` takes four
 * host-derived inputs and, by its own docblock, refuses to resolve any of them
 * itself ("the mode is resolved by the CALLER — this class must not read host
 * configs"). Every execution surface therefore has to build the same object,
 * and until this helper existed four of them built it by hand:
 *
 *   - `chat-v2-orchestration.ts` (the emulated engine)
 *   - `services/evals-runner.ts`
 *   - `routes/shared/evals.ts` (single-case stream)
 *   - `harness/host-executed-mcp-tools.ts` — which built NOTHING, and so
 *     projected a Codex turn's MCP tools under the SDK's defaults rather than
 *     the host's policy. That is the bug this helper exists to make
 *     unrepresentable: a surface that forgets a field now forgets it in one
 *     place, visibly, instead of silently dropping it at its own call site.
 *
 * ## The property that must not be lost
 *
 * When NO host input applies this returns `undefined`, and callers then use the
 * **no-options overload** (`getToolsForAiSdk(ids)`). That is deliberate and
 * load-bearing: a default turn must produce byte-identical tools to what it
 * produced before any of these options existed, and the SDK's `tasks` seam
 * documents the same rule from the other side ("omit and every call takes the
 * pre-existing path, byte-for-byte"). Passing `{}` instead of `undefined` would
 * be *behaviorally* identical today and would quietly invite a future default
 * into the object; returning `undefined` keeps the two paths distinguishable at
 * every call site and in every test assertion.
 *
 * Each field is included only when it is actually asserted:
 *  - `needsApproval` when true (a `false` approval flag is the default);
 *  - `includeAppOnly` when true (the caller resolves `respectToolVisibility
 *    === false` into it — an explicit opt-out of SEP-1865 filtering);
 *  - `modelVisibleMcpToolResults` when defined (a policy object, no default);
 *  - `tasks` when defined (absent === tasks off; see `task-seam.ts`).
