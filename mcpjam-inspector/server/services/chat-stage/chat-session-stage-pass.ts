/**
 * The chat-session derivation pass.
 *
 * Structurally the same shape as `evals/judge-second-pass.ts`, and for the
 * same reasons: the caller is a doorbell that answers before the work
 * finishes, the pass rereads current state rather than trusting anything the
 * doorbell carried, it derives ONCE through the shared SDK analyzer, and it
 * writes under a compare-and-set that makes a duplicate ring produce the same
 * rows rather than a race.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER DOES:
 *
 *   - Spend. There is no model call anywhere in this file. The pass consumes
 *     deterministic criteria and whatever judge verdict already exists; it
 *     never asks for one. A derivation pass that could trigger a judge would
 *     turn every re-mark into a bill.
 *   - Derive twice. `buildChatSessionStageInput` + `deriveStageResults` is the
 *     one path, the same one every eval iteration goes through.
 *   - Move a verdict. Nothing here touches readiness, criteria, a goal score,
 *     an attempt status or a run summary.
 *   - Store free text. Failures are reported as one of the backend's CLOSED
 *     error codes. An exception message from a transcript walker is customer
 *     evidence, and the session row is read by every list payload.
 *
 * SUPERSEDED IS SUCCESS. A no-op apply means someone asked for better work
 * while this was in flight. Retrying would lose the same race again; the newer
 * generation is already pending and will be claimed on its own.
