/**
 * The second derivation pass: re-derive one run's stage rows now that a
 * judge has spoken.
 *
 * The first pass (`finalize-iteration.ts`) runs while no judge has finished —
 * the runner must not wait on a model — so `userValue` (and, for a selection
 * failure, `failureCategory`) land on whatever deterministic evidence existed
 * at the time. This pass reruns THE SAME pure SDK analyzer
 * (`deriveStageResults`, reached through the same `buildStageMetadata`, never
 * a second implementation) with whichever advisory evidence has since
 * arrived attached, and posts only the derivation-owned keys.
 *
 * TWO judges feed this ONE pass: goal-completion's `judgeVerdict`
 * (`StageEvidence.judgeEvidence`, tier-2 input to `userValue`) and D7's
 * `metadataAttributionVerdict` (`StageEvidence.metadataAttribution`, tier-2
 * input to `selection`'s `failureCategory`). An iteration can carry either,
 * both, or neither — `deriveIterationPayload` builds ONE unified stage
 * derivation from whatever is present, and the two verdicts are then posted
 * to their OWN backend surfaces, keyed by their OWN job id
 * (`goalCompletionJobId` / `metadataAttributionJobId`) and reported to their
 * OWN fanout state, because the two judges are independently triggered
 * (D7 does not require goal-completion to be enabled on the suite at all —
 * see the D7 plan §2/§3) and a write to one must never block or misreport
 * the other.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER DOES: touch `passed`, `iteration.result`, or the run's pass/fail
 * counts. That is the whole reason `dual_write` is safe — a judge can move a
 * stage row and a score row, and nothing it does can move a verdict.
 *
 * THAT HOLDS AT `enforce` TOO, and it is the subtlest thing in this module. The
 * judge's row is ADVISORY, so it is structurally excluded from the gating
 * arithmetic that decides the result; the backend refuses lifecycle fields on
 * this route outright (`JUDGE_DERIVATION_LIFECYCLE_FORBIDDEN`); and the
 * backend's own verify seam runs on the merged rows, so if a re-derivation ever
 * DID move the verdict, the run is marked non-gateable rather than quietly
 * re-graded. `enforce` therefore changes what this pass runs FOR (the same real
 * rows `dual_write` writes) and nothing about what it may touch.
 *
 * Idempotent and safe to re-run: the pass reads current state, derives, and
 * posts; the backend rejects a stale job id and refuses terminal iterations,
 * so a duplicate doorbell produces the same rows and the same reports.
