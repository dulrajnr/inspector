/**
 * A HOSTED EVAL on a host-executed-delivery harness must build its MCP tools
 * under the eval host's policies — end to end, from the eval facade down to the
 * SDK call that actually constructs them.
 *
 * `run-harness-turn-host-executed-options.test.ts` pins the turn→projection
 * wiring for the CHAT routes. This file pins the leg the chat routes do not
 * exercise: `driveHostedEvalTurn` → `runAssistantTurn` → `runHarnessTurn` →
 * `projectSelectedMcpServersAsHostTools` → `MCPClientManager.getToolsForAiSdk`.
 * Only the harness sandbox/broker/agent boundary is mocked; every layer that
 * carries a policy is real.
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and why it is the observable
 *
 * `getToolsForAiSdk` refuses to resolve host-derived inputs itself ("the mode
 * is resolved by the CALLER"), so the arguments it receives ARE the tools it
 * produces: a policy that does not reach this call does not reach the model's
 * tool set, and the SDK's defaults silently take over. That is the whole
 * failure mode — no error, no log, just a Codex eval running under a policy its
 * host never chose. Asserting on this call is asserting on what the harness
 * turn ends up with, one layer below where it could be faked by a pass-through.
 *
 * The `harness` cases here FAIL against 3ac4cda2c7, where the eval facade
 * forwarded none of these and the enumeration took the no-options overload.
 * The emulated case passes both before and after — it is the byte-identity
 * guard for the gate that keeps it that way.
