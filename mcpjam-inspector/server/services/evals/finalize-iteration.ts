 * The score-contract keys this mode contributes to iteration metadata, plus —

 *
 * `off` returns `{}` — not empty arrays, not `undefined` values — so the
 * persisted payload is byte-identical to today's. `shadow` writes ONLY the
 * shadow keys; `dual_write` and `enforce` write ONLY the real ones: no mode
 * writes both, which is what makes a shadow row impossible to mistake for a
 * decided one.
 *
 * ── What `enforce` changes, and what it does not ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The PERSISTED KEYS are identical to `dual_write`'s. That is deliberate and it
 * is what makes the rollback a flag flip: dropping a cohort from `enforce` to
 * `dual_write` needs no migration in either direction, because the two modes
 * wrote the same fields.
 *
 * What changes is authority. At `enforce` this returns `derived`, and the
 * caller uses `derived.passed` as the iteration's outgoing `result` instead of
 * the boolean pipeline's `passed`. The rule is the contract's
 * `allGatingScorersPassed` — every gating definition resolved AND every one
 * that resolved to a verdict passed — read STRICTLY, so a gating scorer that
 * errored or was skipped fails the iteration rather than being ignored. Zero
 * evidence never passes, which is also what the legacy pipeline does with an
 * unscorable criterion.
 *
 * ── The evaluation itself is untouched ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `buildEvalIterationVerdict` still runs, still produces `passed`, and is still
 * the thing these rows are a projection OF. What retires at `enforce` is the
 * parallel verdict ARITHMETIC, not the evaluation: the matcher, the predicates
 * and the gates all still decide, and the rows report what they decided. That
 * is why a mismatch between `derived.passed` and `passed` is expected to be
 * ZERO at `shadow` and `dual_write` — two projections of one evaluation cannot
 * honestly disagree — and why a nonzero rate there is a bug signal.
 *
 * AT `enforce` THAT IS NOT QUITE TRUE, and reading it as though it were would
 * make the soak dishonest. The comparison switches to the STRICT reading, and
 * strictness is a DESIGNED divergence: a gating definition that resolved to no
 * usable verdict — no row at all, or an `error`/`skipped` row whose own
 * `onError`/`onSkipped` policy says `fail` — fails the derived verdict where
 * the legacy boolean pipeline may have passed the iteration. That is the
 * safety `enforce` is bought for (zero evidence never passes), so when it
 * fires it is the feature working.
 *
 * So an enforce-mode `grading_shadow_mismatch` means "legacy and strict
 * disagree — investigate", not "something is broken". Check
 * `unresolvedScorerIds`: populated means a designed strictness catch;
 * `disagreeingScorerIds` alone means a real projection bug.

  // THE FLIP, and the ONE DIRECTION IT MAY MOVE.
  //
  // At `enforce` the gating score rows decide — but only ever toward FAILED.
  // The rows are a projection of the evaluation, and that projection is NOT
  // YET TOTAL: `buildEvalIterationVerdict` also gates on `failOnToolError`,
  // pinned tool errors, `iterationError` and `scriptedCheckFailures`, and none
  // of those produce a score row today. A case with one passing predicate and
  // no authored tool-call expectations that fails on a scripted check has an
  // all-passing row set — so reading the rows as the SOLE authority would turn
  // that failure into a pass.
  //
  // Promoting a failure to a pass is the one thing this cutover must never do,
  // and it is not detectable downstream: the backend's verify seam derives
  // from the same incomplete projection and would agree. So the conjunction is
  // the guard, and it is structural rather than a policy someone can tune.
  //
  // WHAT `enforce` ADDS ON THIS PATH, STATED HONESTLY — because an earlier
  // version of this comment overstated it.
  //
  // The strict reading fails an iteration whose gating evidence is missing or
  // unscorable (`unresolvedScorerIds`), where the boolean pipeline would have
  // passed it. Zero evidence never passes. That is the property `enforce`
  // exists for — but it is NOT REACHABLE FROM HERE. Every gating definition
  // this pass builds also gets a row, and every one of those rows is `scored`:
  // predicates and `toolCalls:match` always produce a verdict, and the judge is
  // ADVISORY so it never gates. So `unresolvedScorerIds` is always empty on the
  // first pass, and `disagreeingScorerIds` only fires where the boolean already
  // failed the iteration anyway.
  //
  // The strictness catch therefore lives where gating rows can carry
  // `error`/`skipped`: SDK-REPORTED runs, checked by the backend's verify seam,
  // and any second-pass write that adds a gating row. On the hosted first pass
  // `enforce` is currently a no-op in the failing direction — which is exactly
  // what the soak should be expected to show, rather than being read as the
  // feature not working.
  //
  // The conjunction comes OUT when the remaining legacy gates are projected as
  // gating rows; until then it is what keeps N1 honest. `resultSource` stays
  // `"reported"` either way — the inspector is still the thing reporting the
  // verdict, it has changed what it derives it from.
