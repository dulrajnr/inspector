/**
 * The score-contract definitions a HOSTED iteration grades against.
 *
 * Pure: builders only, no I/O and no evaluation. Every definition goes through
 * the SDK's `resolveScoreDefinition` / `definitionHash` / `evaluationConfigHash`
 * — nothing here hashes by hand, because two producers of the same digest is
 * exactly how a `definitionHash` stops meaning anything.
 *
 * Three scorers, and the roles are the load-bearing part:
 *
 *   | scorerId                  | deterministic | role     | threshold |
 *   |---------------------------|---------------|----------|-----------|
 *   | `predicate:<criterionId>` | true          | gating   | 1         |
 *   | `toolCalls:match`         | true          | gating   | 1         |
 *   | `judge:goalCompletion`    | false         | ADVISORY | resolved  |
 *
 * `role: "advisory"` on the judge is what makes it structurally incapable of
 * gating: `sdk/src/gates.ts` only ever considers gating scorers, so an advisory
 * row cannot decide a customer's CI no matter what it scores.
