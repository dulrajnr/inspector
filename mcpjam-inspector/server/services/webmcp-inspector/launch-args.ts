/**
 * Chromium switches the WebMCP Inspector launches with, and the probe that
 * proved each one necessary.
 *
 * WebMCP ships as a Chrome origin trial, so on a stock profile the page API is
 * absent and a page's `registerTool` calls never run. Forcing the feature on is
 * what makes a developer's own page inspectable without them enrolling an
 * origin in a trial.
 *
 * `--enable-features=WebMCP` is the MINIMAL switch that works: probed against
 * the pinned Chromium (151.0.7922.34 / Playwright 1.62.1), it is the shortest
 * argument set for which `document.modelContext` is defined and a page's
 * registrations reach `WebMCP.toolsAdded`. `--enable-blink-features=WebMCP`,
 * `--enable-features=WebMCPTesting` and
 * `--enable-experimental-web-platform-features` each also work; the last is
 * deliberately NOT used, because it would turn on every unrelated experimental
 * platform feature and change how the inspected page behaves.
 *
 * THE DOMAIN IS NOT THE PROBE. `WebMCP.enable` resolves successfully even on a
 * browser where the feature is off (verified: with no extra switches, `enable`
 * returns OK and no tools ever arrive). Support must therefore be probed in the
 * page — see `PAGE_API_PROBE` — not by whether the CDP command succeeded.
