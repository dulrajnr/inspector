/**
 * `/user-testing` — the User Testing surface. A scenario is one environment —
 * a client and the servers it can reach — published behind a share link; the
 * product question it answers is "what happened when real people used this?".
 *
 *   - `/user-testing`                    — the project's scenarios
 *   - `/user-testing/:scenarioId`        — Insights | Sessions (+ share band)
 *   - `/user-testing/:scenarioId/edit`   — setup, share, docked preview
 *
 * `:scenarioId` is the scenario's SCENARIO id. It used to be the host id, back
 * when every scenario was a client and the two were 1:1. Environment-backed
 * scenarios broke that: several can point at the same host, and the host-keyed
 * query deliberately refuses to return them. The scenario id is the one
 * identity both kinds have, and the one everything downstream — sessions,
 * clusters, insights, the share section — was already keyed by.
 *
 * Links minted under the old scheme still work: a param that matches a host
 * instead of a scenario is redirected to that host's scenario (see the
 * resolution ladder below), as is the older `?host=` query form.
 *
 * The route param is the only view state: no in-page mode flags. The auth and
 * billing gates above this component unmount and remount it several times
 * during a cold boot, and anything held in component state would not survive
 * that. The URL does.
 *
 * Internally everything is still `scenarios` — the surface id, the billing
 * feature, the agent tool group, the Convex tables. Only the product name and
 * the path changed.
