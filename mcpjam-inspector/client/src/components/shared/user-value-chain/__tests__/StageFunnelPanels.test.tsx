/**
 * The funnel panels: what they do when the query answers, and what they do
 * when it cannot.
 *
 * `useQuery` throws when the query is not deployed yet — the expected state
 * during the dark window — and an `ErrorBoundary` only catches what its
 * DESCENDANTS throw. So each exported panel is a thin wrapper whose only job
 * is to put the boundary ABOVE the component that owns the query. That split,
 * rather than a boundary at each mount site, is what makes the guarantee the
 * panel's own: a future caller cannot forget to wrap it.
 *
 * `convex/react` is mocked here so both halves can be driven from one file —
 * a throwing query and a successful one. What the mock cannot prove is that a
 * MISSING PROVIDER is one of the things that throws; that is Convex's own
 * behaviour, and it is covered where it actually matters, by
 * `ScenarioUsagePanel.test.tsx` rendering the real tree with no provider and
 * still passing.
