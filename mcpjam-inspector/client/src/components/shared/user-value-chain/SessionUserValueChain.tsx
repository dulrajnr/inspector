/**
 * One session's user-value chain.
 *
 * Six stages, in chain order, with what each one did and why. It sits beside
 * the surface's own verdict — a readiness strip, a rubric result, a swarm
 * judge — and never replaces it: the chain EXPLAINS an outcome, and a panel
 * that let it look like the outcome would be a second, quieter verdict nobody
 * agreed to.
 *
 * ── What this component refuses to do ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  - **Derive.** Every row is read off `chatSessions.stageDerivation` exactly
 *    as the backend stored it. There is no fold, no inference, no "if there
 *    are tool calls then…". D10a's rule, and D8's: React renders, Convex
 *    persists, the SDK derives.
 *  - **Collapse the three non-verdicts.** `notMeasured`, `notApplicable` and
 *    `notReached` get three different sentences, because "we did not check",
 *    "it does not apply" and "it never ran" are three different facts and one
 *    shared grey dot is how "we never checked" gets read as "it passed".
 *  - **Say "root cause".** A first failed stage is where the chain stopped. It
 *    is not a claim about why, and phrasing that suggests otherwise is how an
 *    operator ends up fixing the wrong system.
 *  - **Hide staleness.** A chain whose evidence has moved is still shown —
 *    with a label. Blanking it would empty the panel on every re-grade.
 *
 * Every user-facing word comes from the SDK's canonical label maps, which are
 * total over their vocabularies: adding a stage reason breaks the label file
 * until somebody writes the words a human reads, rather than silently
 * rendering a wire enum here.
