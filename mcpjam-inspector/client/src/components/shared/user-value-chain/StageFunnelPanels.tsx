/**
 * The two funnel containers: one per surface, each with its own denominator.
 *
 * SEPARATE COMPONENTS, deliberately — mirroring the two separate backend
 * readers. A single container taking a discriminator would be one refactor
 * away from someone passing both populations, and there is no honest way to
 * add a User Testing scenario's sessions to a swarm run's: real people and a
 * persona rehearsal answer different questions, and neither is an eval trial.
 *
 * `useQuery` throws when the query is not deployed yet — and, in a test tree,
 * when there is no `ConvexProvider` at all. An `ErrorBoundary` only catches
 * what its DESCENDANTS throw, never what the component rendering it throws, so
 * each exported panel here is a THIN WRAPPER whose only job is to put the
 * boundary ABOVE the component that owns the query.
 *
 * That split, rather than a boundary at each mount site, is what makes the
 * guarantee the panel's own: a future caller cannot forget to wrap it, and the
 * dark-ship argument does not rest on every mount site remembering.
