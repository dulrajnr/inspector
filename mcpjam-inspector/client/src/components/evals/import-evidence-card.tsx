/**
 * What a finished run's IMPORTED cases were allowed to prove, and on whose say-so.
 *
 * Everything rendered here is FROZEN: the platform derived it from the run's
 * own snapshot at the moment the run started. Nothing on this card is read
 * from the suite's current cases, and nothing on it is the viewer — a run
 * approved last Tuesday by somebody else must not read as approved by whoever
 * happens to be looking at it now.
 *
 * The load-bearing wording is `incomplete`. It is NOT a test verdict: the run
 * has not said the server regressed, it has said its own evidence cannot be
 * relied on. So the card says "not gateable", never "failed" — a screen that
 * blamed the server under test for a conversion nobody finished reviewing
 * would send people to debug the wrong thing.
