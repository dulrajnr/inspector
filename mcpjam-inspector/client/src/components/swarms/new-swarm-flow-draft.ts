/**
 * Remount-durable draft of the New swarm create flow.
 *
 * The flow's whole state lives in component state, and the surfaces above it
 * unmount for reasons that have nothing to do with the user: every Convex
 * `useQuery` re-resolves to `undefined` after a websocket reconnect (the client
 * throws its remote query set away in `onOpen`), and a backgrounded tab is
 * reconnected on return — so the route's "still deciding who you are" spinner
 * takes the subtree down mid-flow and the generated personas go with it. Work
 * the user already paid a model call for must not depend on the tab staying in
 * the foreground, so the resumable part of the flow is mirrored here.
 *
 * `sessionStorage`, like {@link module:lib/environment-draft-seed}: the draft has
 * to survive a remount AND a reload of `/swarms/new` (both land on the same tab)
 * but must die with the tab — a week-old slate silently reappearing on Confirm
 * would be its own bug. `savedAt` bounds the same risk within a long-lived tab.
 *
 * ONE project's flow is stored at a time: the flow is a full-page route, so a
 * second project's draft can only exist after the user left the first, and
 * keying by project (rather than accumulating a map) means a stale entry can
 * never be resurrected by switching back.
 *
 * The launch bookkeeping (`launch`) is here for a sharper reason than
 * convenience: those ids are what make a relaunch idempotent. Losing them to a
 * remount is what would create a SECOND persona and journey per proposal on the
 * retry — the gap the in-memory refs called out and could not close.
