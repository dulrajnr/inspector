/**
 * The page a connection handoff link opens.
 *
 * It renders in its own tree, without AuthKit or Convex, because its visitor
 * may be signed out or a guest and mounting the authenticated shell around
 * them would be both pointless and slow. Everything it can do, it does through
 * `/api/web/server-connections/*` with an HttpOnly cookie it never sees.
 *
 * THE PAGE HOLDS NO CREDENTIAL. The handoff token in the URL is traded for
 * that cookie on first load and then removed from the address bar; after that
 * the only identifier in view is a `scr_…` request id, which is printable by
 * design. Nothing here reads `document.cookie`, and nothing here stores a
 * token — the one thing kept across the OAuth redirect is a request id, so the
 * callback can find its way home.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SHOW. The server's operational URL never
 * arrives: the backend sends `displayUrl`, with query values redacted, because
 * a keyed-endpoint URL's query can be the credential itself. When the original
 * carried parameters the page says so without showing them, so a user can tell
 * "this link had a key in it" from "this link did not" without the key being
 * on screen.
