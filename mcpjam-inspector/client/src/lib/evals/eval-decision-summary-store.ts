/**
 * One request/cache controller for D9's canonical run decision summary,
 * shared by every surface that reads one.
 *
 * ── Why a controller and not three `useEffect`s ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three surfaces read this contract — run detail, the Evaluate suite run
 * history, and the project Runs table — and two of them read it PER ROW. A
 * per-component fetch means a 50-row page is 50 requests the moment it paints,
 * a "Show all" is the whole history at once, and a row visible in two places
 * is fetched twice. The client has no query library to lean on, so this is the
 * smallest thing that makes those three surfaces safe together: one cache, one
 * in-flight map, one global concurrency cap.
 *
 * ── The rules it enforces, and what each one is protecting ───────────────────
 *
 *   - **Dedupe by page key** (project, run, limit, cursor). Two subscribers on
 *     the same page share one request.
 *   - **A GLOBAL cap of four active requests.** Not per-surface: the burst this
 *     prevents is a table's worth of rows, and a per-component budget is no
 *     budget at all.
 *   - **A bounded LRU.** A long session scrolling a runs table would otherwise
 *     retain every summary it ever painted.
 *   - **Abort on the LAST subscriber leaving, never the first.** A row that
 *     scrolls out while another surface still wants the same page must not
 *     cancel that page.
 *   - **A stale window, because a terminal run's summary is not frozen.** Judge
 *     fanout is asynchronous: a run that reads `failed` with a pending judge
 *     can legitimately read differently minutes later. Caching a terminal
 *     summary forever would pin the first answer on screen. Refetch after the
 *     window, and immediately when the observed run row's `revision` changes.
 *   - **Errors are not retried in a loop.** `notFound`, `routeUnavailable` and
 *     `invalidContract` are answers, not blips: they are cached and left alone
 *     until something actually changes. Only `requestFailed` ages out.
 *
 * ── What it deliberately does NOT do ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It knows nothing about run lifecycle, verdicts, or rendering. Callers decide
 * whether a run is terminal (see {@link isTerminalEvalRunStatus}) and nothing
 * here ever derives, aggregates, or repairs a summary — it stores exactly what
 * the contract validated, or exactly why there is none.
