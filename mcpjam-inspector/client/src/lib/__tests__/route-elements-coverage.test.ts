/**
 * Every registered route element is actually MOUNTED.
 *
 * One direction of that invariant has always failed loudly: `buildRouteChildren`
 * throws when an `APP_ROUTES` entry has no element. The other direction used to
 * fail SILENTLY, and that is why this file exists — `buildRouteChildren`
 * iterates `APP_ROUTES`, so a path registered only in `ROUTE_ELEMENTS` is never
 * mounted at all. The URL falls through to the `"*"` catch-all and renders a
 * different screen, with nothing in the console, no failing unit test (a
 * component test mounts the component directly, so it never notices), and
 * nothing to see until somebody follows the link.
 *
 * Not hypothetical: the GitHub install callback reached review registered in
 * `ROUTE_ELEMENTS` alone, which would have landed every return trip from GitHub
 * on the servers screen.
 *
 * `buildRouteChildren` now throws on both directions, so BUILDING the router is
 * the assertion — no source parsing, nothing to keep in step with a regex, and
 * the same check the real app runs at startup.
