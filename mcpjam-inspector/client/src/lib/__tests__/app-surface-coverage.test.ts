/**
 * Route ↔ surface coverage.
 *
 * The point of this file: a new screen must not be able to ship
 * agent-invisible. If someone adds a route and forgets the manifest, the
 * screen would still work for humans while silently not existing for the
 * assistant — `ui_navigate` couldn't reach it and the atlas wouldn't mention
 * it. That's the failure this catches, and it's why the diff runs BOTH ways.
 *
 * Reads only pure data modules on purpose (see `app-routes.ts`).
