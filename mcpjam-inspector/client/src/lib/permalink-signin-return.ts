/**
 * Getting an agent-minted permalink back after the WorkOS round trip.
 *
 * The most important recipient of a permalink is often signed OUT: someone
 * pastes `https://app.mcpjam.com/servers/<id>?project=<demo>` into a fresh
 * browser. Before this module the app signed them in, AuthKit returned them to
 * `/callback`, and `/callback` renders Connect — so the path AND the
 * `?project=` scope were both gone by the time they were authenticated. They
 * landed on whichever project their picker defaulted to, which is precisely
 * the wrong-project landing the permalink work exists to end, reintroduced at
 * the last step.
 *
 * Modelled on `server-connection-handoff.ts`'s sign-in return, and
 * deliberately the same shape: the PATH never crosses the network, only a
 * nonce does. AuthKit round-trips `state` through the authorization server, so
 * anything put there is visible to it and in the user's URL bar; the path is
 * kept in same-origin `sessionStorage` and re-validated as same-origin on the
 * way out.
 *
 * A permalink carries no credential, so nothing here is a security boundary —
 * it is a correlator, and the failure mode of losing it is landing on the app
 * shell, exactly as today.
