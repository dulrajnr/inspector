 * navigation both change the requested project without remounting anything.
 * This reconciles continuously — every render, against the live pathname.
 *
 * Two races it closes explicitly:
 *   - a slow switch to A resolving after the user has already navigated to B
 *     (the result is dropped: only the LATEST requested id may win);
 *   - the same switch being fired over and over while it is in flight.
 *
 * It never navigates. A project that cannot be resolved leaves the URL alone
 * and reports `inaccessible`; the boundary renders one generic message. An
 * automatic bounce to a default project is exactly the "quietly showed you
 * someone else's data" behavior being removed.
