/**
 * Wire contract between the WebMCP Inspector's client surface and its server
 * session service.
 *
 * TRANSPORT-AGNOSTIC ON PURPOSE. V1 carries events over SSE and commands over
 * HTTP POST, which is what the rest of this codebase does and what a
 * single-process local inspector needs. The hosted stage will put the same
 * messages on a WebSocket and a later provider will run the browser somewhere
 * else entirely; none of that should require re-deriving the message shapes,
 * so nothing here mentions SSE, POST, or Playwright.
 *
 * `viewportTransport` is the seam for that move: V1 always reports
 * `native-window` (the browser opens on the developer's own machine and they
 * drive it directly), while a remote provider reports an interactive URL and a
 * frame-streaming provider reports `frame-stream`. The client renders whichever
 * it is handed, so adding a transport does not change this file's consumers.
