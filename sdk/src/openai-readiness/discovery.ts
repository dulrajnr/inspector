/**
 * Wire evidence for an OpenAI readiness run.
 *
 * Everything here dials the target, and nothing here grades it. The split
 * matters more than usual for this product: the grading half is a pure function
 * a hosted surface can run on evidence gathered elsewhere, and a check module
 * that could open a socket would be a way around the pinned transport a hosted
 * run is required to use.
 *
 * `fetchFn` IS REQUIRED, with no default. In a hosted run it must be the
 * DNS-pinned transport, and a default would make the unguarded case the easy one
 * to reach.
 *
 * WHAT IS OPENAI-SPECIFIC HERE. Only three things; the rest is the shared
 * `directory-readiness/discovery` core:
 *
 *   - EVERY advertised authorization server is fetched, not just the first.
 *     Anthropic's client uses `authorization_servers[0]` and nothing else, so
 *     the Claude runner deliberately stops there; ChatGPT documents support for
 *     multiple issuers, and a runner that looked at one would report a
 *     multi-issuer server as healthy on the strength of an entry the host may
 *     never pick.
 *   - the domain-verification challenge, which is a plain GET at a fixed path.
 *   - the tool listing, read for annotations, schemas and security schemes.
 *
 * Node entry only — it is exported from `sdk/src/index.ts`, never from
 * `browser.ts`, so importing the result model can never pull a transport in.
