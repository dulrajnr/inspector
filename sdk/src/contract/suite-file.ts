/**
 * The versioned eval **suite file** — one declarative document describing a
 * suite, its defaults, and its cases.
 *
 * This module is browser-safe and intentionally has no node-only deps.
 *
 * This file is the CONTRACT, not the loader. It says what a valid suite file
 * is; reading YAML, resolving defaults onto cases, and `eval validate` are a
 * separate concern that consumes these schemas. Two rules follow from that
 * split and are load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **No `.default()` anywhere.** An omitted field stays omitted, so
 *     `parse(x)` is byte-stable through `canonicalJson` and back. Default
 *     *semantics* are documented in the JSDoc beside each field and applied by
 *     the loader; materializing them here would mean a file grows fields it
 *     never declared every time it round-trips, and the diff of an unchanged
 *     suite would be full of values nobody wrote.
 *  2. **Every object this file DECLARES is `.strict()`, and so is every object
 *     the step union declares.** A mis-mapped import field must fail loudly
 *     rather than be silently dropped — the failure mode this schema exists to
 *     prevent is an importer that "succeeds" while quietly discarding half of
 *     what it read. Strictness also matches Convex `v.object`, which rejects
 *     unknown fields, so a permissive schema here would accept payloads the
 *     backend refuses.
 *
 *     `stepsSchema` closed with this file (see `./steps.ts`), because step
 *     level is where a mis-mapped import field actually lands and leaving it
 *     open reproduced the whole failure one level down. Two reused things stay
 *     open on purpose: a tool call's own `arguments` object, whose keys belong
 *     to the server's input schema rather than to this contract, and
 *     `predicateSchema`, which is a separate contract module with its own
 *     mirror, its own fixtures and many more authoring surfaces — closing it is
 *     a change made THERE, with its own consumer audit, not a side effect of
 *     adding a file format. What IS guaranteed is that the generated JSON
 *     Schema describes the same behaviour (see the generator's `io: "input"`
 *     note): the two validators never disagree about which files they accept,
 *     even where they are both permissive.
 *
 * ── Reserved values are ERRORS, not ignored ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `mode`, `reportingMode` and `captureLevel` each have values reserved for
 * capabilities that do not exist yet. Every one of them is a VALIDATION ERROR
 * in `schemaVersion` 1. Accepting-and-ignoring a reserved value is the worst
 * available outcome: a file that says `captureLevel: "none"` and captures
 * everything is a privacy incident with a paper trail claiming otherwise.
 * Because they are expressed as `z.literal`, the generated JSON Schema emits
 * `const` and rejects them structurally too.
 *
 * ── Versioning policy ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `schemaVersion` is `const "1"`. Additive OPTIONAL fields stay within `"1"`; a
 * breaking revision becomes `"2"`. A v1 validator handed a `"2"` file says so in
 * words that name the fix ("upgrade the CLI/SDK"), because the alternative — a
 * generic "invalid enum value" — sends people to edit a file that is correct.

 *     gradeable trial. An explicit `N` REPLACES that floor with

 *   - `maxEvaluatorErrorRate` — defaults to **0.1**.
 *
 * The three are INDEPENDENT checks; the loader resolves the coverage rule into
 * `ResolvedEvalSuiteFileValidity.coverage`, and
 * `contract/verdict-policy.ts` is where a verdict is decided against it.
 *
 * A run that misses any of these is INVALID, which is not the same as failed: a
 * suite whose judge errored on half its iterations has not measured the server,
