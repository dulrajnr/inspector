/**
 * `EvalStageAnalyticsV1` — one run's stage funnel, materialized.
 *
 * This module is browser-safe and intentionally has no node-only deps, and it
 * is PURE: no ctx, no network, no clock. Every timestamp it carries is passed
 * in by its caller.
 *
 * ── What this is for ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Where do trials fall out of the chain, and does that differ by intent, by
 * model, or by host?" — answered from ONE indexed derived row per run, not by
 * scanning iteration metadata and not by reading trace blobs. The precedent is
 * the denormalized run summary, and the reason is the same: a dashboard that
 * aggregates raw child rows gets slower with every run and eventually stops
 * answering at all.
 *
 * ── The rules this shape exists to enforce ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **1. Counts are stored; rates are derived.** Nothing persisted here is a
 * rate, a mean, a percentile or a confidence interval. Storing `passRate: 0.8`
 * throws away the numerator and the denominator, and a stored rate cannot be
 * re-sliced, re-checked, or told apart from `4/5` and `800/1000` — which are
 * very different claims. The rate helpers at the bottom of this file derive
 * every rate on demand and every one of them ships its arithmetic.
 *
 * **2. A zero denominator is `notMeasured`, never `0`.** This is the single
 * failure mode the whole contract is built against: `0/0` rendering as `0%` and
 * being read as "everything failed", or as `100%` and being read as "all
 * green". {@link EvalStageRate} makes it unrepresentable as a number.
 *
 * **3. Unknown is not a drop-off.** A trial whose stage captured nothing is
 * excluded from the reach denominator with a named class, not counted as having
 * failed to reach. Every exclusion is COUNTED and returned: a denominator that
 * quietly shrank is indistinguishable from a server that quietly improved.
 *
 * **4. Marginals only — never a cross-product.** Slices are `overall`,
 * `intent`, `model`, `host`, each independently. There is deliberately no
 * intent×model×host cube: it multiplies row size by three dimensions' cardinality
 * for cells that mostly hold one or two trials, and a funnel computed over two
 * trials is not a comparison. See {@link EvalStageAnalyticsSlice}.
 *
 * **5. Trials are the unit.** {@link EvalStageAnalyticsV1.measurementUnit} is
 * the literal `"trial"` and is carried on the row rather than assumed. An eval
 * iteration, a user-testing session and a swarm traversal share this
 * vocabulary but are NOT the same measurement unit, and a denominator that
 * silently mixes them is a number with no meaning. The literal is what makes a
 * mistaken merge fail loudly.
 *
 * ── Provisionality ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A judge second pass can REWRITE stage attribution after the run first becomes
 * terminal. So this row is rebuilt after terminalization and again after each
 * applicable judge fanout completes, and it says which it is:
 * {@link EvalStageAnalyticsV1.materializationState} is `provisional` while any
 * applicable fanout is still pending and `final` afterwards. A consumer that
 * renders a provisional row as settled will show a funnel that changes under
 * the reader with no explanation.
 *
 * ── Absence ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No backfill. Runs from before this shipped have no row, and a missing row
 * renders as UNMEASURED — never as zero, and never as a funnel of empty stages.

 * Folding them into one list would produce a tally whose keys mean different

 *
 *   - `lifecycle`      — the trial never produced a comparable observation:
 *     not terminal, skipped, cancelled, timed out, setup-failed, execution
 *     failed, or the evaluator itself errored.
 *   - `integrity`      — a chain or a measurement was missing, unverified or
 *     rejected at the write boundary. NOT a passing observation. Never coerced.
 *   - `version`        — produced by an analyzer or schema version this reader
 *     does not understand. Also not coerced: a version-ahead payload may mean
 *     something different by the same word.
 *   - `notApplicable`  — the stage does not apply to this case at all.
