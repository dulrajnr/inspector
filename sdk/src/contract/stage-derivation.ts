/**
 * Deriving a stage's state from one run — the output side of the user-value
 * chain vocabulary pinned in `./chain.ts`.
 *
 * `./chain.ts` deliberately stops at the enums ("pinning the derivation output
 * belongs to whoever writes the derivation"). This module is that derivation:
 * the row shape, the reason codes, and the pure function that turns one
 * iteration's authored case + captured evidence into six stage rows.
 *
 * `deriveStageResults` is PURE and deterministic — no Convex ctx, no network,
 * no LLM, no clock. Same input, same six rows, forever. The validators live at
 * the bottom of the file and the analyzer functions themselves never touch `z`,
 * so they stay trivially unit-testable (the arrangement `analyzeSession` uses
 * in `mcpjam-backend`'s `convex/lib/sessionReadiness.ts`).
 *
 * Three rules this module exists to enforce, none of which are negotiable:
 *
 *   1. **Non-vacuity.** A stage reaches `passed` only when at least one piece
 *      of eligible evidence was actually inspected. Zero evidence is
 *      `notMeasured`. This is the whole point: a chain derived from missing
 *      spans that quietly reads as green is worse than no chain at all.
 *   2. **`notReached` is derived from POSITION**, per `USER_VALUE_STAGES`
 *      order — but only over a stage that measured NOTHING. A stage after the
 *      first failure that has its own evidence keeps its own row: a run
 *      disproves "never ran" the moment it produces a verdict for that stage.
 *      The array is normative; this module never sorts it.
 *   3. **`evaluator` is never folded into another category.** A broken grader
 *      is not a server defect, and counting it as one poisons every rate
 *      derived from it.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 *   - It never GUESSES `failureCategory: "metadata"` from the deterministic
 *     evidence alone. That category means "tool names, descriptions or
 *     schemas misled the model", which is a judgement about intent that no
 *     span carries on its own. `categoryFor`'s `selection` branch below is
 *     reachable, but ONLY through `evidence.metadataAttribution` — a scored,
 *     evidence-carrying verdict from the D7 judge (attributed elsewhere:
 *     `metadata-attribution` second-pass). No deterministic span or predicate
 *     ever produces it.
 *   - It never enforces policy. A policy block is REPRESENTED here
 *     (`notMeasured` + `blockedByPolicy`); enforcing it belongs elsewhere.
 *   - It never reads `finishReason`. That field is advisory display only and
 *     must never feed a gate (see `EvalTraceSpan.finishReason`).
