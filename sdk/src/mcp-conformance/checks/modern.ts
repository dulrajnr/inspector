/**
 * Modern-era (2026-07-28) MUST checks — Phase 7 §15.3.
 *
 * Everything here is on the RAW evidence path: each check asserts something
 * only the wire can prove — a header the official client refuses to send, a
 * member the client consumes and hides before app code sees it, or an HTTP
 * status the client folds into an in-band error. The client-provable modern
 * evidence lives with the other client checks (`modern-client-handshake` in
 * `core.ts`).
 *
 * Two authoring rules this module follows everywhere:
 *
 *   1. **HTTP status and in-band JSON-RPC code are SEPARATE facts.** On the
 *      modern wire an HTTP 400 arrives WITH a well-formed JSON-RPC error body,
 *      and the SDK surfaces that body in-band as a `ProtocolError` — so
 *      official-client evidence alone cannot tell "400 + -32020" from
 *      "200 + -32020". Each check asserts both from the capture and reports
 *      them independently, so a failure names which half is wrong.
 *   2. **Hostile framing never goes through a client.**
 *      `TransportSendOptions.headers` skips reserved header names, so a probe
 *      that needs a wrong `Mcp-Method` / `Mcp-Name` / `MCP-Protocol-Version`
 *      MUST build the request itself (see `raw-http.ts`).
 *
 * The spec's HTTP status mapping for ladder-produced errors (the statuses
 * asserted below) is: -32020 HeaderMismatch ⇒ 400, -32022
 * UnsupportedProtocolVersion ⇒ 400, -32021 MissingRequiredClientCapability ⇒
 * 400, -32601 MethodNotFound ⇒ 404. Handler-produced errors (e.g. -32602 for a
 * missing resource) stay in-band on HTTP 200.

 * (`readiness-protocol-version-header-required`). `Mcp-Method` has no such
 * carve-out: the spec calls the standard headers "REQUIRED for compliance"
 * flatly, and the reference server rejects a request without it.
