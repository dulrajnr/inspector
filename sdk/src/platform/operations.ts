// Three operations rather than the resource family's two. Resources need
// `list` + `read`; skills need `list` + `get` + `read file`, because
// `skills/get` reaches a skill a partial listing never mentioned — a URI can
// arrive from the server's own `instructions`, from another skill's body, or
// from a user — and that is the reason the SEP has `skills/get` at all.
//
// Every one of these answers with EITHER content or a `refusal` naming the
// integrity check that failed. The refusals are the product: a debugger's user
// asking "why won't this skill load" is asking exactly which digest, which
// field, which URI.

// ── Directory readiness operations ───────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Grading a server against a publisher's app directory, as an operation.
 *
 * ## Why a start returns a receipt rather than a grade
 *
 * A readiness run dials somebody else's server, follows its redirects, walks
 * its listings and sometimes asks a model to read the result. That does not
 * fit in a request, so the platform runs it durably: the start answers `202`
 * with a run id and the caller polls. Every surface that offers these
 * operations has to say so — a model told "start a run" and handed a receipt
 * will otherwise report the receipt as the answer.
 *
 * ## Why the starts declare `risk: "spend"` when the default is free
 *
 * `includeLlmObservations` is the only field that costs anything and it
 * defaults off, so most runs are free. But `risk` is a static declaration read
 * by five surfaces to decide how much ceremony a call needs, and a field that
 * described the cheap case would be describing the case that does not need
 * describing. The worst case is what a spend guard has to be told; the
 * agent's `confirmSeverity` is a function precisely so the approval copy can
 * still say "this one is free" when the flag is off.

/**
 * Authored test-step (`TestStep`) input — the unified test model that REPLACES
 * the old `query` / `expectedToolCalls` / `promptTurns` / `caseType` /
 * `probeConfig` authoring fields (see the inspector's `shared/steps.ts`).
 *
 * A case is an ordered `steps` array of:
 *   - `prompt`   — a user message (model-driven turn);
 *   - `toolCall` — a deterministic, model-free tool call (= old widget probe);
 *   - `interact` — one pure widget action (click/type/key/scroll/wait);
 *   - `assert`   — an assertion (a `Predicate` like `toolCalledWith` /
 *                  `widgetRendered`, or a DOM `WidgetAssertion`).
 *
 * Typed permissively here (discriminated only on `kind` + the per-kind core
 * fields); the backend `/api/v1` route validates authoritatively with the
 * shared `stepsSchema`. Declared fully so the body is forwarded verbatim
 * instead of having unknown keys stripped.
 *
 * BREAKING (Phase 2.5): this is a clean break from the old per-case authoring
 * fields. No users existed for the old shape, so no compatibility layer.

 * server that needs OAuth needs a human at a browser, and a request with no
 * project needs someone to choose one. So the honest result of a successful
 * call is often `awaiting_authorization` plus a link, not a connected server.
 * Callers are expected to present the link and then poll
 * `get_project_server_connection_status`.
 *
 * `handoffUrl` IS A PRIVATE CAPABILITY. Anyone holding it can complete the
 * authorization, so a surface must deliver it to the requester alone —
 * ephemerally in Slack, behind an owner-checked button in Discord — and never
 * let a model repeat it in prose. The agent adapter strips it from
 * model-visible text for exactly this reason.
