/**
 * Read and write eval **suite files** — the loader the contract module says is
 * a separate concern (`./contract/suite-file.ts:7-9`).
 *
 * PURE and browser-safe: text in, text out. No `node:fs`, no `node:path`, no
 * `process`. It lives in the SDK rather than in the CLI because three
 * consumers need it — `mcpjam cloud eval validate`, the importer/mapping work, and a
 * future `validate_eval_suite` agent tool — and a loader that only the CLI can
 * reach forces the other two to re-author it.
 *
 * ── One parser, one code path ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * YAML is canonical and JSON is accepted, and there is no format sniffing to
 * choose between them: JSON is a subset of YAML 1.2, so the YAML parser reads
 * both. A sniffing branch would be a second code path that can disagree with
 * the first about the same bytes.
 *
 * Exactly ONE document is a suite file. A multi-document stream is rejected
 * rather than having its first document read, because "the file declared three
 * suites and we ran one" is a silent loss of two thirds of an authored
 * artifact.
 *
 * ── Authored vs resolved ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * {@link loadEvalSuiteFile} returns BOTH the validated authored value and an
 * in-memory resolved value with the documented defaults applied onto cases.
 * {@link serializeEvalSuiteFile} accepts only the AUTHORED value. That is the
 * whole mechanism protecting the contract's rule 1 (no `.default()` anywhere):
 * a resolved default has no path back into a file, so a file cannot grow
 * fields nobody wrote by round-tripping through this module.
 *
 * ── Findings ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every failure is a {@link SuiteFileFinding}: a stable machine `code`, a field
 * `path`, and a human `message`. Findings are sorted into document order and
 * carry no timestamps, no absolute paths and nothing whose order depends on a
 * filesystem, so two runs over the same bytes emit byte-identical output — the
 * property a CI diff needs and a `Map` iteration order cannot promise.
