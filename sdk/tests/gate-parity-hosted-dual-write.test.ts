/**
 * Gate-report parity across the `dual_write` flip — promotion gate (e).
 *
 * `evaluateGates` fails OPEN when a run carries no definition snapshot
 * (`src/gates.ts`, the `hasSnapshot` guard): every score-shaped policy on a
 * hosted run is a silent `non_gateable` today. `dual_write` gives those runs
 * rows and definitions, so the same policy STARTS DECIDING — on an operator
 * flag flip, in a customer's CI. This harness pins where that can and cannot
 * happen, so the flip is reviewed rather than discovered.
 *
 * Three findings, each asserted below:
 *   1. Rows alone change NOTHING: `scoreIntegrity` is a separate tri-state, and
 *      a hosted run without an integrity verdict stays non-gateable with a full
 *      score contract attached. That is the real blast-radius answer.
 *   2. Rows plus `scoreIntegrity: "valid"` DO flip score gates from
 *      `non_gateable` to `passed`/`failed`. Non-score gates are untouched.
 *   3. An advisory judge row never participates, even when it errors or fails.
