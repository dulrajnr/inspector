/**
 * `EvalStageAnalyticsV1` and its reference aggregation.
 *
 * The suite is organized around the ways a funnel LIES:
 *
 *   - a zero denominator rendered as a number;
 *   - an excluded trial that leaked into a denominator;
 *   - a payload we could not read, counted as a passing observation;
 *   - one copied setup signal counted once per iteration;
 *   - a truncated slice array that reads as "these are all the models";
 *   - and two incomparable runs drawn side by side as a comparison.
 *
 * Plus the golden fixture, which is the conformance target the backend's
 * hand-written materializer is checked against — the two implementations may
 * differ, their semantics may not.
